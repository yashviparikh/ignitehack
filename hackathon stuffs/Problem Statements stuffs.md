## Problem Statements

1.  Collaborative Drawing App with AI Suggestions.  

### Background & Description  
In an increasingly connected world, creativity thrives when people collaborate. This project focuses on building a real-time collaborative drawing platform enhanced with AI-powered suggestions. Multiple users can simultaneously sketch and create artwork on a shared canvas, while an AI model provides intelligent suggestions such as shapes, color palettes, or finishing touches based on their input. This fusion of live collaboration and generative AI encourages creative expression and innovation, making digital art more interactive and accessible.

### Objective  
Create a web-based collaborative drawing application where multiple users can draw together on a shared canvas in real time. Integrate an AI system that listens to the ongoing artwork and suggests relevant shapes, colors, or enhancements to help users complete their illustrations creatively.

### Core Features to Implement
- Real-time collaborative canvas with live syncing (using WebSockets or Firebase)  
- AI-powered suggestions for shapes, color palettes, or illustration completions based on user input  
- Version history to track changes and revert to previous states  
- Export options to save artwork in common formats (PNG, SVG, etc.)  
- Voice-to-doodle feature that converts voice commands or descriptions into drawings

2.  Food Rescue Matchmaker Mobile Application/Website.  

### Background & Description  
Food waste is a major global issue, with surplus food often going to landfill while many people face food insecurity. This project aims to design and develop Food Rescue Matchmaker application/website that connects restaurants and cafes with surplus food to NGOs and volunteers who can redistribute it. By leveraging features like GPS, camera, and push notifications, the platform will enable real-time coordination to minimize food waste and maximize community impact.

### Objective  
Build an application that allows restaurants and cafes to post donations of surplus food with photos and location in real time. NGOs and volunteers should be able to quickly accept donations, track pickups live, and view impact dashboards showing metrics such as meals saved, daily beneficiaries (food provided to needy people by NGOs) using appropriate graphs i.e. bar chart, line chart, pie charts, etc.

### Core Features to Implement
- Real-time donation posting with photo and location details  
- Quick acceptance of donation requests by NGOs/volunteers  
- Live tracking of food pickup status  
- Impact dashboards displaying meals saved and daily beneficiaries of the food  
- Integration of mobile-native/website features such as GPS, camera, and push notifications

3.  Sign Language Story Time - audio track.  

### Background & Description  
Storytelling is a powerful way to share culture, experiences, and emotions. However, for the deaf community, stories told in sign language often face accessibility barriers for wider audiences. Many hearing individuals struggle to fully understand sign language, while automatic captions often fail to capture cultural nuances and context. This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a platform where deaf creators can share stories in sign language, while AI generates accurate captions along with cultural/linguistic explanations for hearing audiences. This fosters inclusivity, understanding, and cultural appreciation.

### Objective  
Develop an AI/ML-powered platform where deaf creators can upload stories in sign language. The system should automatically generate synchronized captions and provide contextual explanations so that hearing audiences can fully appreciate and understand the narratives.

### Core Features to Implement
- Sign Language Recognition: Use AI/ML models (e.g., computer vision + deep learning) to interpret and translate sign language gestures into text captions.  
- Auto-Generated Captions: Provide real-time captions aligned with the video stream, ensuring accessibility for hearing users.  
- Cultural Context Explanations: Enhance captions with clarifications about idioms, expressions, or cultural nuances unique to sign language storytelling.  
- Creator-Centric Platform: Allow deaf creators to upload, or record their stories in sign language.  
- Multi-Language Support: Option to generate captions in multiple spoken languages for global reach.  
- Interactive Experience: Enable viewers to toggle between plain captions and captions with contextual explanations.  
- Export & Sharing: Allow stories to be saved and shared with embedded captions for broader accessibility.

4.  Secure Blockchain-Based Voting Portal.  

### Background & Description  
Elections depend on trust: voters must believe their ballots are recorded accurately, counted fairly, and kept private. Traditional digital voting systems and paper processes face issues like tampering, lack of transparency, limited accessibility, and audit difficulties. A blockchain-based voting portal can increase transparency and integrity by immutably recording ballots, while cryptographic techniques preserve voter anonymity. This project builds a secure, user-friendly platform to make voting more accessible, auditable, and trustworthy for civic elections, organizational votes, or poll-based decision-making.

### Objective  
Design and implement a secure voting web or mobile portal that lets eligible voters cast ballots anonymously while ensuring each vote is immutably recorded, verifiable, and tamper-resistant. The system must balance transparency (auditable chain of custody) with strong voter privacy and accessibility.

### Core Features to Implement
- Voter Authentication & Eligibility: Secure onboarding to verify voter eligibility (e.g., OAuth, ID-verify APIs, or admin-uploaded roll). Protect privacy — do not store personally identifiable voting choices on-chain.  
- Anonymous Ballot Casting: Use cryptographic primitives (blind signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, or mixnets) to unlink voter identity from their cast ballot while preventing double-voting.  
- Blockchain Ledger: Record ballot hashes/commitments on a permissioned or public blockchain to provide immutable, auditable evidence of submitted votes.  
- End-to-End Verifiability: Allow voters to receive a receipt or proof (e.g., ballot commitment) they can use to verify their vote was included without revealing their choice.  
- Secure Tallying: Implement on-chain or off-chain tallying with cryptographic proofs (verifiable shuffles or homomorphic tallying) so anyone can audit results while preserving secrecy.  
- Admin Dashboard: Election managers can create ballots, set eligibility, schedule open/close times, monitor status, and publish final results and audit logs.  
- Audit Logs & Transparency: Publish non-sensitive audit data and cryptographic proofs so independent auditors or the public can verify integrity.  
- Privacy & Compliance: Design for data minimization, GDPR/region-specific compliance, and clear retention policies for logs and cryptographic artifacts.

6.  Real-Time SOS Blood Donation Platform.  

### Background & Description  
In medical emergencies, delays in arranging compatible blood donors can cost lives. Existing systems are often fragmented, manual, and dependent on outdated donor lists or hospital stock availability. With the growing demand for quick access to blood during surgeries, accidents, and critical health conditions, there is a pressing need for a real-time, community-driven platform that connects patients with suitable donors instantly. This project envisions a web-based SOS blood donation system where patients or hospitals can raise urgent requests, automatically match with verified donors, and trigger live alerts to ensure rapid response. The ultimate goal is to save lives by minimizing delays in finding compatible blood and to make the donation process more transparent, reliable, and efficient.

### Objective  
Design and develop a real-time blood donation platform that allows patients and hospitals to raise emergency blood requests, matches them with compatible donors, and facilitates immediate communication through an SOS alert system.

### Core Features to Implement
- SOS Alert System: Raise and broadcast emergency blood requests and send instant alerts to nearby donors.  
- Donor Registration & Management: Verified donor profiles with blood group, availability, and location details.  
- Blood Match Finder: Automated donor-patient matching based on compatibility and proximity.  
- Real-Time Notifications: Notify donors via app, SMS, or email for immediate response.  
- Patient/Hospital Dashboard: Track requests, donor responses, and fulfilment status.  
- Data Security & Privacy: Ensure safe handling of sensitive patient and donor information.
