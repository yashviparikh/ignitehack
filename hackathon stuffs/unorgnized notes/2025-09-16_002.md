Exactly âœ… â€” youâ€™ve spotted a very important point.

Right now, the **allocation logic is donation-driven**, not NGO-demand-driven:

* In each round, we look at **remaining donation quantity**.
* We allocate `min(ngo_capacity, remaining_quantity)`.
* If remaining quantity is **less than NGO capacity**, the NGO will only receive that smaller leftover portion.

ðŸ‘‰ That means the NGOâ€™s *full capacity isnâ€™t necessarily satisfied*. Itâ€™s only satisfied if the donation pool has enough to fill it.

---

### Example:

* NGO capacity = **150**
* Donation quantity = **80**
* Allocation = `min(150, 80)` â†’ NGO gets **80**
* NGO still has unmet demand (70), but donation is finished.

This is actually correct in most food donation cases, because:

* NGOs list their **maximum capacity** (upper bound), not guaranteed demand.
* Donations may not always meet full NGO demand.

### ðŸ”§ But if you want to ensure **NGOs get filled to their demand whenever possible**, we could:

1. Add a **priority fill strategy** â†’ once an NGO is chosen, try to allocate as much as possible in next rounds until its capacity is fully filled.
2. Or keep the current **fair split** â†’ donation gets distributed among multiple NGOs even if some have unmet capacity.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Question:
Do you want to modify the logic so that **once an NGO is selected, it continues to receive allocations in later rounds until its capacity is full (if donation quantity allows)**?

That will make it **NGO-centric** instead of **donation-centric**.
